React project requested by an university subject

The app was created with the objective of make the games & softwares search easier without web-scrapping.
I used the most common sites of keys I know and possibly, in the future, I'll update and add more sites and make the search more interactive and easy by using web-scrapping.

The following sites are available:
- G2A(https://www.g2a.com)
- Nuuvem(https://www.nuuvem.com)
- Eneba(https://www.eneba.com)

You can create your own account to store your searches and favorite it

To open it, go to directory folder and run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
